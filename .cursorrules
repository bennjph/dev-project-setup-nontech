# Cursor Project Rules

**Read `CLAUDE.md` for complete project context, CTO role, and workflow.**

This file provides Cursor-specific quick reference and model preferences.

---

## Project Quick Reference

- **Project**: [PROJECT NAME]
- **Description**: [One sentence — what this project does]
- **Tech Stack**: [Brief: e.g., "React + TypeScript + Supabase"]

See `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/TECH-STACK.md` for full details.

---

## Workflow Overview

We follow an 8-phase process:

1. **`/create-issue`** → Capture bugs/features to backlog
2. **`/explore`** → Deep analysis, ask questions, read code (no coding yet)
3. **`/create-plan`** → Generate markdown plan with progress tracking
4. **`/execute`** → Implement plan step-by-step
5. **`/review`** → Self-review code for issues
6. **`/peer-review`** → Cross-model validation
7. **`/document`** → Update docs and architecture notes
8. **`/learn`** → Teaching mode for understanding

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed workflow documentation.

## Cursor-Specific Guidance

### When to Use Composer vs Chat

**Use Cursor Composer** for:
- ✅ Simple, fast tasks (boilerplate, refactoring)
- ✅ UI component changes
- ✅ Quick fixes and tweaks
- ✅ Multi-file editing for straightforward changes

**Use Cursor Chat** for:
- ✅ Complex architecture decisions
- ✅ Database schema changes
- ✅ Business logic implementation
- ✅ Debugging tricky issues
- ✅ Anything requiring deep thinking

### Working with Plans

When executing a plan (from `/create-plan`):

1. Tag the plan file: `@plans/current-plan.md`
2. Composer can read the plan and implement steps
3. Update plan file as you complete steps (emoji status)

## Model Preferences

When user manually switches models:

| Model | Use For | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Claude (via Claude Code extension)** | Planning, exploration, main development | Best at understanding context, asking questions |
| **GPT (via Codex extension)** | Gnarly bugs, complex debugging | Deep problem-solving |
| **Gemini (optional)** | UI/frontend design | Great visual results |
| **Cursor Composer** | Fast tasks | Blazing speed for simple work |

---

## Quality Reminders

Before shipping:
- ✅ Run `/review` (self-review)
- ✅ Run `/peer-review` (cross-model validation)
- ✅ Update docs with `/document`
- ✅ No console.log, no hardcoded secrets, no TODOs

---

## File Structure Awareness

```
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md   ← System design (read first)
docs/TECH-STACK.md     ← Technology choices
docs/WORKFLOW.md       ← How we work
docs/decisions/        ← ADRs
docs/backlog/          ← Issues to work on
plans/                 ← Active execution plans
```

**Before starting work**: Check `plans/` for active work.

## Cursor Slash Commands

Available in `.cursor/commands/`:

- `/create-issue`
- `/explore`
- `/create-plan`
- `/execute`
- `/review`
- `/peer-review`
- `/document`
- `/learn`

See individual command files for full prompts.

**Remember**: Read `CLAUDE.md` for the complete CTO context. This file is just a quick reference for Cursor users.
